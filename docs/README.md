## Getting Started

Please see the main [README.md](../README.md) at the root of this repository for installation instructions and a quick overview of the project.

## Architecture

SecMaze follows a modern, scalable architecture that separates frontend and backend concerns while integrating blockchain and machine learning components. For detailed architecture diagrams and explanations, see [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md).

## API Reference

The SecMaze API provides endpoints for user authentication, maze generation, and interaction tracking. For detailed API documentation, see [API.md](./API.md).

## Frontend Components

The frontend is built with React and Next.js, utilizing a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability. For detailed frontend documentation, see [Frontend.md](./Frontend.md).

## Backend Services

The backend is built with Express.js and provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend. For detailed backend documentation, see [Backend.md](./Backend.md).

## Blockchain Integration

SecMaze integrates with blockchain technologies for decentralized threat intelligence sharing and token rewards. For detailed blockchain documentation, see [Blockchain.md](./Blockchain.md).

## Machine Learning Module

SecMaze uses machine learning for detecting automated solvers and analyzing interaction patterns. For detailed ML documentation, see [MachineLearning.md](./MachineLearning.md).

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. For detailed testing documentation, see [Testing.md](./Testing.md).

## Deployment

For deployment instructions and best practices, see [Deployment.md](./Deployment.md).
