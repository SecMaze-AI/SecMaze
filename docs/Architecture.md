## Component Breakdown

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and Next.js, utilizing a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability.

#### Key Components

- **Pages**: Next.js pages for different routes within the application
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI components like buttons, cards, inputs, etc.
- **Context Providers**: React Context API for state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for common tasks
- **API Clients**: Functions for interacting with the backend API

#### Frontend Data Flow

1. User interacts with a component (e.g., clicks a button)
2. Component dispatches an action or calls a function
3. Context or state is updated
4. Components re-render with new data
5. If needed, API calls are made to the backend

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Express.js and provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend.

#### Key Components

- **Routes**: Express.js routes for handling API requests
- **Controllers**: Business logic for handling requests
- **Services**: Core functionality and database interactions
- **Models**: MongoDB schema definitions
- **Middleware**: Authentication, validation, etc.

#### Backend Data Flow

1. Frontend makes an API request
2. Express routes the request to the appropriate controller
3. Controller validates the request and calls service functions
4. Service layer interacts with the database or external services
5. Response is sent back to the frontend

### Database Architecture

SecMaze uses MongoDB as its primary database for storing user data, maze configurations, and analytics.

#### Key Collections

- **Users**: User accounts and authentication data
- **Mazes**: Generated maze configurations and solutions
- **Interactions**: User interaction data for ML analysis
- **Analytics**: Aggregated analytics data

### Blockchain Integration

SecMaze integrates with Ethereum-compatible blockchains for token rewards and decentralized threat intelligence sharing.

#### Key Components

- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum smart contracts for tokens and data
- **Web3 Service**: Service layer for interacting with the blockchain
- **Wallet Integration**: User wallet management

### Machine Learning Architecture

SecMaze uses machine learning for detecting automated solvers and analyzing interaction patterns.

#### Key Components

- **Data Collection**: Collecting user interaction data
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting features from raw data
- **Model Training**: Training ML models on labeled data
- **Inference**: Using models to classify new interactions

## Deployment Architecture

SecMaze is designed to be deployed on cloud infrastructure, with separate services for frontend, backend, database, and machine learning components.

                              +----------------+
```

## Security Architecture

SecMaze implements multiple layers of security:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all inputs

## Scalability Considerations

SecMaze is designed to scale horizontally:

- **Stateless Backend**: Allows for easy scaling of backend services
- **Database Sharding**: Partitioning data for better performance
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Queue-based processing for non-critical tasks

## Future Architectural Enhancements

- **Microservices Migration**: Breaking down the monolithic backend into microservices
- **Serverless Functions**: Moving certain functionality to serverless architecture
- **Advanced Caching**: Implementing more sophisticated caching strategies
- **Real-time Analysis**: Enhancing real-time ML analysis capabilities
